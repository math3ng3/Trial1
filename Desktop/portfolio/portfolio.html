    <h2>About me;</h2> 
    <em>Andrew Mathenge</em> born and raised in <strong>Nairobi</strong>, Kenya. I moved to the city as an infant with my parents, who later enrolled me into Catholic parochial school, 
            where I sat my KCPE National exam and excelled without a doubt. 
            Upon my completion of primary school I joined Upper Hill School in the year 2016 and completed in 2019, where again I did fairly well.
            I then joined my friends, who were running a sticker shop known as <span>Kl0ut stickerz</span>  and there I gained salemanship know how. 
            Unfortunately the pandemic struck and we were forced to close down our shop and sadly had to part ways. <br> So in my free time, I strated checking out easy to relate to, computer courses 
            with my highschool based knowledge. That's where I stumbled into Software Development course at Moringa School. As I dug deeper and deeper I got fascinated by the course but the
            facts that captivated me most were; One, that software Devlopment doesnt have a constant learning curve and secondly,
            the fact that it actually encourages creativity.
